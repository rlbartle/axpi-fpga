# axpi-fpga
Linux kernel module to interface with FPGA via SPI  This module is part of a project utilising a Raspberry Pi to send audio out of multiple SPDIF outputs. We hope to achieve 4 outputs but it depends on the SPI throughput. The module interfaces with a closed source userspace app which feeds it Raw PCM data and which SPDIF output it is to be sent out to.
